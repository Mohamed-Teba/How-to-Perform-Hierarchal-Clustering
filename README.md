# 🌳 How to Perform Hierarchical Clustering 📊

This Repo demonstrates the application of **hierarchical clustering** to group data points into meaningful clusters based on their similarity. By exploring agglomerative and divisive clustering techniques, this system provides a clear guide to clustering data effectively. 🌟

## 🌟 Overview

Hierarchical clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique used to uncover patterns in data, with applications in customer segmentation, bioinformatics, and more. This project implements hierarchical clustering using Python, focusing on both agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down) approaches. It builds on the author's previous work, such as the [Heart Disease Detection Using Fuzzy Clustering](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Heart-Disease-Detection-Using-Fuzzy-Clustering), emphasizing clustering techniques. 🧮
